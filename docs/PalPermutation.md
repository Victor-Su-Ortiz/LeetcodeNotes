# PalPermutation

## Problem Description
Given a string s, return true if a permutation of the string could form a palindrome and false otherwise.

## Approach
Given it is finding permutations the order does not matter but the count of characters still matters
we need to counts the chars and ensure there is at most one odd count

## Time Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
